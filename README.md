# Womanium Summer 2023
This repository is to show to a global audience about the potential of quantum computing. 
It will contain things that I find interesting each week from the Womanium lectures.

The current plan for upcoming articles:
- Qubits and Quantum Physics
- Introduction to Quantum Computing
  - Circuits, Logic Gates, and Reversible Computing
- Quantum Communication
  - Quantum Key Distribution
