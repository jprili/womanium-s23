# Womanium Summer 2023
This repository is to show to a global audience about the potential of quantum computing. 
It will contain things that I find interesting each week from the Womanium lectures.

Completed:
  - [Qubits and Quantum Physics](https://github.com/jprili/womanium-s23/blob/main/src/intro.md)
  - [Circuits and Algorithms](https://github.com/jprili/womanium-s23/blob/main/src/circuits.md)

The current plan for upcoming articles:
- Quantum Communication
  - Quantum Key Distribution
