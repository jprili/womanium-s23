# Qubits and Quantum Physics
Before talking about Quantum Computing,
it would be ideal to discuss concepts in computing and quantum physics first.

## Classical Computers  
A computer generally refers to a machine that does arithmetic and logical operations.
To satisfy this definition, a computer would first need to have some way to represent the logic state.
This "logic state" will be called a **bit**, which is a binary set containing two values: 0 or 1, `true` or `false`.
It will be the fundamental logic element that a classical computer will build upon for its operations.
Hardware-wise, this is achieved via transistors and/or diodes, 
where the bit representation is analogous to the prescence of current running through them.
